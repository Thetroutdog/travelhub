1. Understanding Collections

A collection is a file containing all your trips.

You might create:
	•	One collection for yourself
	•	One for your spouse
	•	One for work travel
	•	One for a specific year

The current collection name appears in the header.

If you see a small indicator next to it, that means there are unsaved changes.

⸻

2. Creating a New Collection

Click New.

If you have unsaved changes, you’ll be asked to confirm before clearing your current trips.

A new collection starts empty and is named Untitled until you save it.

⸻

3. Opening a File

Click Open and select a Travel Hub .json file.

If you already have trips loaded, you’ll be asked:
	•	Open (Replace) – Replace current trips with the file
	•	Merge – Add trips from the file into your current collection

Merge keeps your current collection name and adds the new trips.

8. Saving & File Locations (Important)

Travel Hub runs entirely in your browser.

For security reasons:
	•	The browser cannot modify files in place.
	•	Each time you click Save, a new file is downloaded to your Downloads folder.

If you opened a file from Desktop:
	1.	Save your changes
	2.	Go to Downloads
	3.	Move the new file back to your preferred folder

The app shows a reminder about this the first time you open a file.
